## Goals
- Explore the implementation of the Branch and Bound algorithm and its significant enhancements.
- Understanding how the initial approach evolved into a more efficient solution that takes underestimation into account.

## Implementations
### First implementation: Shortest path.
Branch and Bound method without underestimation, choosing the shortest path in each case without considering the total cost of the other paths.

### Second implementation: Shortest path with underestimation.
Implementation of the shortest path with underestimation, choosing the shortest path in each case while considering the Euclidean distance from the node to the goal node.

## Extra features
- Count of generated and visited nodes
- Total cost
- Timestamps
- Implementation of all test routes
